		<p class="story">
			A lively debate surrounds cyber conflict. Governments are actively
			participating in global and regional dialogues to prevent and mitigate
			conflict in cyberspace. However, several governments contributing to these
			debates are interested in using their advanced ICT capabilities in pursuit
			of their political, economic and military goals. Scholars disagree on
			whether cyber conflict even exists. Agreeing that information and
			communication technologies are widely used to pursue political goals, they
			also find that such uses of ICTs do not generally meet the threshold of
			use of force and that ICTs are primarily employed within the confines of
			an already pre-existing conflictual situation. Therefore, cyber conflict,
			while much discussed, remains an under-examined phenomenon.
		</p>
		<p class="story">
			For the purposes of the Cyber Conflict Portal, we have identified six
			strands of politico-military uses of ICTs that we consider incompatible
			with international peace, security and stability. The first iteration of
			the CCP examines individual effect-creating cyber operations. Our next
			iterations will focus on cyber campaigns, cyber offenses targeted against
			public trust and the international community, cyber espionage, domestic
			cyber conflict and advanced persistent threat induced cybercrime. This
			ontology of cyber conflict is intended to draw attention to trends and
			patterns in the use of ICTs for malicious and hostile purposes and to
			inform debates and discussions of how to best prevent and mitigate the
			various threads of politico-military use of ICTs.

		<p class="story">
			Since 2007, in more than twenty occasions, states or state-sponsored
			actors have inflicted damage on another state using ICTs.

		<p class="story">
			While often such damages are relatively benign, such as downtime of public
			services or inaccessible information on a website, several incidents have
			resulted in significant economic damages or affected critical services.
			Effects of cyber operations include manipulation, disruption and

		<h1>Sectors</h1>

		<p class="story">
			Most affected by cyber operations is the financial sector. Cyber
			operations also affect manufacturing processes, disrupt the supply of
			electricity and public transportation. States have disrupted fuel supply

		<h1>Conflicts</h1>
		<p class="story">
			Unlike other military operations, hostile uses of ICTs mostly occur
			outside acute military conflict. Cyberspace facilitates low-intensity
			conflict between nuclear powers and allows operational presence away from
			the operating state’s territory. Most states engaging in cyber operations
			have established a cyber command.

		<h1>Dyads</h1>
		<p class="story">
			Scholars have noted the dyadic nature of cyber conflict – in most
			instances, cyber operations are situated in pre-existing political
			tensions. However, for some states, ICTs offer a new opportunity to engage

		<h1>Processes</h1>
		<p class="story">
			Global and regional cybersecurity dialogues are dominated by states using
			ICTs to achieve their domestic, regional and global ambitions. At the same
			time, these dialogues do not include other countries frequently engaging
			in cyber operations.
